# Magic

Is sort of QNXs TLS I guess. Its position is up to the loader/kernel/proc, but there
will be always far pointer in the segment 0x78 pointing to MAGIC.

# Early create

Not clear if the process start in SLIB or calls into SLIB. Watcom shows it starting in SLIB, but there is code
in CRT pointing to the opposite.

Stack upon entry to SLIB looks like this:
    MAIN
    MAIN SEG
    ARGC
    ARGV1
    ARGV2 ...
    NULL
    ENV1
    ENV2 ...
    NULL
    PID
    PARENT PID
    NID (was 1, guess)
    ??
    Stack top

Most of the allocation in QNX is done using a SBRK style algorithm, so the values should be placed
after BSS.

The registers have following meaning on loader <-> slib and slib <-> program interface:
EBX = curbrk (end of sbrk memory)
ECX = free memory after curbrk (basically data segmen end - curbrk)
EDX = stack low
